AccNinja Free Accounting Scholarship Website
Project Overview
This project is a single-page website for AccNinja, an accounting school offering free scholarships to fresh graduates, rural women, and people with disabilities from the Global South. The website highlights the scholarship program, its unique curriculum focused on modern AI tools in accounting, eligibility criteria, and how to apply.

Accessibility First: Incorporates lang attributes, descriptive alt text for images, and properly linked <label> elements for forms to ensure usability for assistive technologies.
